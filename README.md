# MoralDescColorMapStimuli

This repository contains a portfolio of randomly-generated maps following certain constraints for experimental validity. These maps will be used as experiment stimuli by Duke University's Data Visualization with Cognitive Neuroscience team to test the effects of color mapping on moral decision-making.

File basemap_combined contains code for programatically creating all maps. 

map_plots folder has one folder for each scenario, colormap, and intuition. 
Within each of these folders is sixteen versions of that specific map.
