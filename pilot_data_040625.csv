Aid should be distributed based on need of citizens. After all, not all the citizens would have voted not to implement the emergency measures. So why penalize them? I tried to focus on the damage caused that needed addressing rather than the penalties.  Or the value judgment about blame and praise which are also so subjective to think about. I do understand that the penalty might incentivize people to prepare better. But what more incentive could there be that is better than the experience of being through a storm. Those that prepared would fare much better. Observing that and experiencing that should make a bigger impact than a monetary penalty in the next year.

If overall damage was low, I decided that only part of the total budget would need to be spent. I didn't see any instructions stating that 100% of the emergency funds needed to be spent. If damage in all four provinces was equal, I split equally between the provinces the amount of the budget that I deemed necessary to use. I found it hard to give praise or blame to the citizens because weather forecasts can change so rapidly and aren't always accurate. Additionally, the precautions taken if an emergency was declared were extensive. It might be more appropriate to have two stages of emergency preparedness. I could see where many of the citizens would be reluctant to vote for such disruptive and expensive measures.  Assigning a penalty percentage felt a little more objective. I could assess a penalty without assigning blame or praise.

The greater the damage (1-10 scale), the more resources needed for rescue, recovery, and mitigation. The damage level directly influenced the allocation of emergency funds.
State of Emergency Decision:
Provinces that declared a state of emergency were seen as proactive and responsible. Those that didn't were penalized for poor preparedness, affecting both resource allocation and federal budget penalties.
Responsibility & Preparedness:
