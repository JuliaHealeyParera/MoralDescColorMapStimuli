Storm Information

Natural disasters often cause a high degree of damage. Especially in highly inhabited areas, thousands of people may be affected or killed. During the first few days after a natural disaster, the speed at which emergency relief materials are delivered makes a big difference. Quick responses by local agencies in the form of search-and-rescue teams, food and water deliveries, and financial support for alternative housing and medical care saves lives and can dramatically reduce the extent of damage to homes and businesses. Unfortunately, there are often not enough emergency resources available to provide help to everyone affected.

Cresta is a very small island nation with four separate provinces separated by an uninhabitable area. When a natural event that can cause damage is forecasted to hit Cresta, the forecast information available is broadcast widely to all citizens, and then the citizens in each province vote on whether their province should launch a state of emergency. During a state of emergency, non-essential businesses and services are closed, province residents are evacuated to assigned locations, extra precautions are taken to fortify critical infrastructure, and reserve province personnel are assigned to assist with preparations. These emergency preparations are expensive and very disruptive to the province and the people who live there, but can effectively help save lives and prevent damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure (like roads, power lines, and water pipes).

Three days ago, Cresta learned that a storm was approaching that would affect the entire island country. The storm was predicted to be between a category 3 and 4 (out of a possible 5). The citizens of each province voted on whether to launch a state of emergency, and each province acted according to the result of the vote. The storm hit last night and caused a lot of damage. Cresta must now determine what proportion of its emergency resource fund allocated to this storm should be assigned to each province to support immediate rescue, aid, and damage mitigation efforts.

In addition, to incentivize Cresta’s provinces to make responsible emergency preparedness decisions, Cresta is piloting a program that would penalize provinces that manage natural disasters poorly. Each year, federal funds are given to each province to support the province’s general needs. Each province distributes the federal funds across their different projects, priorities, and needs as they see fit. Under the new pilot program, Cresta may apply up to a 5% penalty to each province’s overall budget from the federal government next year in response to the quality of the province’s management of this specific storm. Any money not allocated in a given period will not be used for any other particular purpose in the nation, nor will it be carried over to the following year’s budget.

For this study, we will visually represent Cresta with maps like the one below, indicating voting decision with bolding and underlining. If a given province voted to undertake emergency precautions, their province name will be underlined and bolded.

I also looked at the relationship between preparation and outcomes, observing that despite Province D's preparedness, it experienced the highest damage, while Province A, despite not preparing, had the lowest damage. When it came to resource allocation, I balanced the immediate needs based on damage levels with accountability for the preparedness decisions. In considering future incentives, I focused on encouraging better decision-making without being overly punitive.

The level of damage experienced by each province: This was the most critical factor in allocating the emergency budget. Provinces with higher damage levels have a greater immediate need for resources for rescue, aid, and rebuilding.
The correlation between the voting outcome and the damage level: Provinces that did not declare an emergency and subsequently suffered high damage were viewed as having managed the situation poorly, potentially justifying a penalty to incentivize better preparedness in the future. Conversely, provinces that didn't declare an emergency but experienced little damage presented a more nuanced situation regarding penalties.
The principle of fairness and proportionality: I aimed to allocate resources based on need while also considering the responsibility of each province for its decisions.

Level of Storm Damage – This was the biggest factor in dispatching emergency assets. Provinces that were hit harder needed more immediate help, whether or not they prepared.

Emergency Preparedness (Voting Choice) – I checked whether a province voted to enact a state of emergency. Prepared provinces took wise decisions and should not be penalized, despite still heavy destruction. Preparedness-Non provinces that did not prepare but suffered unnecessary damage were considered options to punish.

Preventability of Harm – If injury could reasonably have been avoided through preparation, and a province had not prepared, that was considered in the assessment of a penalty.

Fairness and Incentives – I attempted to weigh saving lives and responding to immediate needs against holding provinces accountable. The goal was to create increased future preparedness without punishing people in dire need.",Yes,Extremely good,Extremely good,Always,Very much,Slightly,Somewhat,Very much,Very much,Completely,Completely,Very much,Completely,Female,,Right-handed,Black or African American,28,Slightly Conservative,Slightly Conservative,Christianity/Non-Catholic,,Extremely religious,Master's degree,"Employed for wages part-time,A student","$100,001 - $150,000",67ec75846034d709d669d8aa,3,"Start, Int_Blu_4321, Int_Blu_6211, Int_Blu_8642",intuitive_blue

If a province declared an emergency then I allocated a funding amount in exact proportion to how much of the total storm damage was sustained in that province and applied no penalty to future funding. If a province did not declare an emergency then I allocated slightly less funding to that province than their proportion of total storm damage and applied a small penalty for future funding. I think a small drop in funding and a small penalty is appropriate because a large one could be counterproductive. If the funding drop is too large in the future the province may not have adequate preparedness even if they correctly declare an emergency and may suffer catastrophically large damage would could have a huge negative effect on the overall island economy and well-being of all citizens. A small funding drop and penalty is meant to nudge the province in the direction of choosing to be more cautious about declaring an emergency. However, if year after year one province continually does not declare an emergency and suffers large damage even in the face of a continually shrinking budget then this strategy may need to be re-thought.",No,Extremely good,Extremely good,Always,Very much,Somewhat,Very much,Very much,Very much,Completely,Very much,Completely,Completely,Male,,Right-handed,White,35,Somewhat Liberal,Somewhat Liberal,None,,Not at all religious,Bachelor's degree,Employed for wages full-time,"$100,001 - $150,000",673133b9c16e3df02dd40b41,3,"Start, Unint_Roc_4321, Unint_Roc_6211, Unint_Roc_8642",unintuitive_rocket
